# Fixed-Rate Credit: A Missing Primitive in DeFi

## Summary

Onchain credit lacks fixed-rate options despite their dominance in traditional finance. Fira addresses this gap by introducing maturity-based borrowing and lending, building on the proven success of the Usual Stability Loan.

## The Current State of Onchain Credit

Variable-rate lending dominates DeFi's $60B+ lending market, with over 99% of exposure being floating-rate. Interest rates fluctuate based on supply and demand rather than loan duration or risk characteristics.

This creates three critical limitations:

- Borrowers cannot lock in predictable financing costs
- Lenders face uncertainty about future returns
- Protocol treasuries struggle to forecast obligations

These constraints prevent DeFi credit from supporting long-term strategies and structured financial activities.

## Fixed-Rate Credit as Essential Infrastructure

Traditional finance relies on fixed-rate instruments—mortgages, corporate bonds, and sovereign debt—supporting approximately **$145T globally**. This scale reflects the necessity of predictable terms for meaningful financial planning.

DeFi's absence of comparable fixed-rate products represents a fundamental structural gap limiting the ecosystem's maturity.

## USL: Evidence of Market Demand

The Usual Stability Loan demonstrated viable demand for onchain fixed-rate credit:

- Fixed 5% borrowing rate
- USD0-collateralized loans
- Organic growth exceeding **$400M in six months**

This success proved both market viability and sustained user appetite for predictable credit arrangements.

## Fira's Framework

Fira implements maturity-based credit discovery, allowing users to select specific terms and durations. The platform will launch with **Usual Zero Rate (UZR)** during its initial phase, complementing rather than replacing existing variable-rate markets.
