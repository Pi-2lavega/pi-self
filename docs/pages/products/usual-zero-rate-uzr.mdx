# Usual Zero Rate (UZR)

## Executive Summary

The Usual Zero Rate (UZR) is built on top of Fira and enables users to access low-cost leverage on bUSD0.

## Fundamentals

### bUSD0 and USD0

bUSD0 represents the locked form of USD0 until a defined maturity date. Unlike directly accessible USD0, bUSD0 typically trades below par on secondary markets and converges towards 1.00 USD0 as maturity approaches.

### Borrowing Mechanism

Users can deposit bUSD0 as collateral to borrow USD0 at a **0% base rate, plus a 10 bps (0.10% APR) fee**. The system applies a fixed-price oracle valuing bUSD0 and USD0 at a 1:1 ratio, maximizing borrowing capacity.

## Leverage Strategy

The leverage loop works as follows:

1. Deposit bUSD0 as collateral
2. Borrow USD0
3. Swap USD0 for bUSD0 at a discount
4. Redeposit the acquired bUSD0
5. Repeat until maximum leverage

## Detailed Numerical Example

### Initial Parameters:
- Initial collateral: 1,000 bUSD0
- Maximum LTV: 0.88
- Swap rate: 880 USD0 → 950 bUSD0 (price: 0.9263 USD0)
- Borrowing fee: 10 bps annually

### Step 1:
Deposit 1,000 bUSD0, borrow 880 USD0

### Step 2:
Swap 880 USD0 for 950 bUSD0

### Step 3:
Deposit 950 bUSD0, borrow 836 USD0

### Position after loop:
- Total collateral: 1,950 bUSD0
- Total debt: 1,716 USD0

### Step 4:
Interest accrues until maturity
- At 10 bps APR over 1 year: ~1.716 USD0 in interest
- Example with 8 USD0 interest

### Step 5:
At maturity, bUSD0 resets to 1.00 USD0

### Profit Calculation Formula:

```
Profit = Total Collateral - (Total Debt + Interest)
```

- With 8 USD0 interest: profit ≈ 226 USD0
- With 10 bps APR: profit ≈ 232.284 USD0

## Maximum Leverage

**Maximum leverage formula:**

```
Leverage_max = LTV / (Price - LTV) + 1
```

This formula determines the maximum achievable leverage based on LTV and the realized exchange rate.

## Key Considerations

- The UZR only accepts bUSD0 as collateral
- The Usual DAO is the sole lender/supplier for the vault
- Users must repay USD0 debt to recover their collateral
- A dedicated USL to UZR migrator contract is available for existing USL users
