# Overview

Welcome to the Fira documentation. Fira is a lending and borrowing protocol specialized in facilitating permissionless fixed-rate markets onchain.

## What is Fira?

Fira introduces fixed-rate, maturity-based borrowing and lending as a native onchain primitive. The platform addresses a major limitation of decentralized credit: the absence of predictable fixed rates, enabling better long-term financial planning.

## Key Features

- **Floating-Rate Markets**: Variable rate lending and borrowing based on utilization
- **Dynamic Lending**: Intelligent liquidity allocation between fixed and floating markets
