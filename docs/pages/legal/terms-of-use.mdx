**Non-custodial model:** You retain control of private keys and wallet. The operator does not hold assets, initiate transactions on your behalf, or reverse blockchain-confirmed transactions.

**Protocol separation:** The operator does not guarantee continuous operation of blockchains, oracles, bridges, third-party tokens, or smart contract availability.

**Information disclaimer:** Displayed rates, prices, APY, and health metrics are indicative and may be delayed, inaccurate, or incomplete.

## 4. Nature of Information – No Advice

Nothing constitutes financial, investment, credit, legal, tax, or accounting advice, nor any personalized recommendation.

You bear sole responsibility for decisions and risk assessment, including determining appropriateness for your circumstances. Crypto-assets and DeFi involve volatility unsuitable for many users.

## 6. Economic Mechanics

**Wrapping:** Fira V1 operates with FW-USDC wrapping/unwrapping for certain operations.

**Borrowing:** May involve minting BT-USDC against collateral and swapping BT-USDC→FW-USDC at a discount. The economic cost is embedded in that discount.

**Fixed-maturity rates:** Predictability applies to holding until maturity; early repayment may change effective costs.

**CT-USDC:** May exist and be tradable, reflecting coupon components and redistribution linked to reserve rehypothecation mechanisms.
