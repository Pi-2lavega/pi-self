# Collateral Risk

## Overview

Collateral assets used in Fira markets may experience deterioration or failures that impact position health and protocol stability.

## Risk Description

Collateral risk encompasses two primary categories:

### Market Deterioration

General market conditions may cause collateral assets to lose value relative to borrowed assets, increasing liquidation probability.

### Asset-Specific Failures

Individual collateral assets may experience:

- Smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits
- Oracle manipulation or failures
- Depegging events (for stablecoins or pegged assets)
- Liquidity crises specific to the asset
- Governance attacks or protocol failures

## Materialization Scenarios

### Sudden Price Drops

Rapid collateral devaluation exceeds user response capability.

### Depeg Events

Pegged assets lose their peg, causing immediate health factor deterioration.

### Protocol Exploits

Underlying collateral protocols experience security incidents.

### Liquidity Crises

Collateral assets become illiquid, preventing orderly liquidation.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Conservative Collateralization

Maintain LTV well below LLTV to create safety buffers.

### Collateral Diversification

When possible, avoid concentration in single collateral types.

### Active Monitoring

Regularly monitor collateral health and market conditions.

### Understanding Asset Risks

Research and understand the specific risks of each collateral asset.

## Protocol-Level Mitigations

Fira may implement:

- Collateral quality assessments
- Exposure limits per collateral type
- Conservative LLTV parameters for riskier assets
- Real-time monitoring and alerts

## Important Notice

Collateral risk cannot be eliminated. Users should:

- Understand the specific risks of their chosen collateral
- Maintain conservative position sizing
- Be prepared for rapid market movements
- Accept the possibility of total collateral loss
