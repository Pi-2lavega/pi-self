# Smart Contract Risk

## Overview

Fira is a blockchain-based protocol with **inherent smart contract risk**. The protocol relies on software code deployed as smart contracts. These may contain **vulnerabilities, bugs, design flaws, or unintended behaviors**, whether known or unknown at the time of deployment.

Any such issues, whether exploited by third parties or triggered by unforeseen conditions, could result in **partial or total loss of funds**, including loss, theft, misallocation, inability to withdraw, forced liquidations, or broader disruption of protocol functionality.

## Sources of Failure

Smart contract failures may arise from:

- Implementation errors
- Incorrect assumptions about external integrations (tokens, oracles, bridges, DEXs)
- Edge cases during extreme market conditions
- Permission or upgrade mechanisms
- Governance actions
- Interactions with other ecosystem contracts

**Important:** On-chain transactions are irreversible, and losses may be permanent.

## Mitigation Measures (No Guarantees)

### Independent Audits

Fira engages third-party security firms to review code and identify vulnerabilities. However, **audits do not guarantee that code is safe or free of defects**. Vulnerabilities may remain undiscovered even after multiple audits.

**Completed Audits:**
- Sherlock (November 2025)
- Spearbit Cantina (November 2025)
- yAudit (December 2025)

### Operational Protections

The protocol may have the capability to **pause, suspend, or restrict certain functions** in response to a suspected incident or active exploitation. These measures may reduce damage but can also cause **service disruptions**, reduced liquidity, or delayed withdrawals.

### Incident Response

Fira may investigate security incidents and attempt recovery actions. **Recovery remains uncertain** and may prove impossible, incomplete, delayed, or dependent on third parties.

## Key Limitations

Despite these measures, **risk cannot be eliminated**. By using Fira, users acknowledge that they:

- Interact with experimental and adversarial environments
- Risk that the protocol may fail or behave unexpectedly
- May lose all or part of their assets
- Have no insurance or security guarantee unless otherwise stated in writing

## Best Practices for Users

- Only deposit what you can afford to lose
- Monitor official communication channels for security updates
- Consider the experimental nature of all DeFi protocols
- Review audit reports and understand their limitations
- Keep informed about protocol upgrades and changes
