# Risks & Security

## Overview

Fira is an experimental protocol with inherent risks. Users should fully understand these risks before interacting with the platform.

## Risk Categories

### [Interest Rate Risk](/resources/risks-and-security/interest-rate-risk)

Both fixed-maturity and floating-rate markets face exposure to interest rate volatility. Rates can move rapidly and may be difficult to predict.

### [Liquidation Risk](/resources/risks-and-security/liquidation-risk)

Collateralized borrowing carries material liquidation risk. Liquidations may occur rapidly, automatically, and without notice.

### [Bad Debt Risk](/resources/risks-and-security/bad-debt-risk)

Bad debt materializes when borrower collateral cannot be liquidated for sufficient value to repay outstanding debt.

### [Collateral Risk](/resources/risks-and-security/collateral-risk)

Collateral assets may experience market deterioration or asset-specific failures that impact position health.

### [Liquidity Risk](/resources/risks-and-security/liquidity-risk)

Liquidity risk encompasses the inability to enter, exit, repay, or unwind positions at a reasonable price or within an expected timeframe.

### [Smart Contract Risk](/resources/risks-and-security/smart-contract-risk)

The protocol relies on smart contracts that may contain vulnerabilities, bugs, design flaws, or unintended behaviors.
